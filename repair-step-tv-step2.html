    <p><strong>Step 2 of 3:</strong> Some other common issues to detect with your TV include,
       <b> No Sound: </b>This can be caused by the TV being on mute, a problem with the speaker, or an external device connected to the audio output. 
<b> Distorted Sound:</b> This can be due to a faulty speaker, a loose cable, or a problem with the TV's audio settings. 
<b> Audio Delay: </b>
This can occur if the TV is not receiving the audio signal correctly or if there is a problem with the external speakers.  </p>
